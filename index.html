            <h2>Gulab jamun</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <p>To make Gulab Jamun, you will need 1 cup milk powder, ¼ cup all-purpose flour (maida), 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), ¼ teaspoon baking soda, ¼ cup warm milk (adjust as needed), 1 teaspoon lemon juice (optional), and 1-2 tablespoons yogurt (optional) for the dough. For the sugar syrup, you will need 1.5 cups sugar, 1 cup water, 3-4 crushed cardamom pods, 1 teaspoon rose water (optional), and 1 teaspoon lemon juice (to prevent crystallization). Lastly, for frying, use oil or ghee.</p>
            <h3>Process:</h3>
            <p>To make Gulab Jamun, start by preparing a soft dough using khoya (mawa), all-purpose flour, baking soda, and cardamom powder, adding a little milk as needed. Shape the dough into small, smooth balls without cracks. Heat oil or ghee on low flame and deep-fry the balls until golden brown, stirring gently for even cooking. Meanwhile, prepare sugar syrup by boiling sugar, water, cardamom, and rose water until slightly sticky. Once the jamuns are fried, soak them in warm sugar syrup for at least 1-2 hours, allowing them to absorb the sweetness. Serve warm or chilled for a delicious, melt-in-the-mouth treat!</p>
